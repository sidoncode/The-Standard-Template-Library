C++ Maps are sorted associative containers that contain unique key/value pairs. For
example, you could create a map that associates a string with an integer, and then use that
map to associate the number of days in each month with the name of each month.

From the above definition we get that map will have two parameter(_datatype,_datatype)

>> // The intialization/ declaration of the map will be
>> map<int, int> m1;
// here m1 -> is the name of the map
// here map will store the both integer type (int, int)
>> map<int, int> :: iterator itr
